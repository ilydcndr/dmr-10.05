A set of image elements are listed in the DOM followed by the remove buttons.

Write the removeElementsHandler() function that register a click  handler and do this logic:
- When the button (that has the class of "remove") is clicked, its parent <div> element is removed from the gallery.

Requirement:
  - No jQuery
  - Optionally use ES6

TIP: Write your codes in the test1.js within the removeElementsHandler() function ONLY
